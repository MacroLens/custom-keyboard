This is a KiCad project folder with my original prototype. It uses some libraries it might not need and was based heavily on [ruiqimao's guide](https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide/blob/master/README.md) with some minor tweaks.

*Note*
The diodes are on the wrong side and the footprint has no capability for LEDs.Which the future prototype will address.
